links to useful things on the internet

##2014, October

* [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/) - realtime html/css editor  
* [Cubic Bezier Generator](http://cubic-bezier.com/#.91,.09,.83,.67) - generate nice curves  
* [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) - cloud-enabled HTML5 Markdown editor  
* [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) - JSFiddle ROCKS. It's a way of life. Try it.  

* [Linkclump](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkclump/lfpjkncokllnfokkgpkobnkbkmelfefj) - Chrome extension. With this installed you can r-click and lassoo any or all the above links, and they'll each open in new tabs. Pretty sweet. 
* [Bulk URL Opener](http://melanto.com/apps/bulk-url-opener/) - same kinda vibe as the above except you drop a list of urls into it and hey presto. Good if you want to create a particular workspace / toolset from a pre-prepared list.
